# 🚀 Copilot Instructions Repository

Welcome to the **Copilot Instructions** repository!  
This project provides a set of best practices, coding rules, and prompt instructions to guide AI-assisted development, especially with GitHub Copilot and similar tools.

## 📚 What does this repository do?

- Defines clear coding standards and architectural rules (e.g., Domain-Driven Design, testing strategies).
- Provides prompt and instruction files for consistent, high-quality code generation.
- Helps teams and AI tools follow the same guidelines for maintainable, robust, and expressive code.

## 🛠️ How to use this repository

1. **Clone the repository**  
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/copilot-instructions.git
   ```
2. **Explore the instructions**  
   - Check the `.github/instructions/` folder for coding rules and best practices.
   - Review prompt files in `.github/prompts/` for AI guidance.
   - Read the `copilot-instructions.md` file for Copilot-specific and C#-specific workflow rules.
3. **Apply the rules**  
   - Follow the documented standards in your projects.
   - Use these files to configure Copilot or other AI tools for consistent code generation.

## ✨ Features

- 🏛️ Domain-Driven Design (DDD) guidelines ([see instructions](.github/instructions/domain-driven-design.instructions.md))
- 🧪 Unit & Integration testing best practices ([see instructions](.github/instructions/unit-and-integration-tests.instructions.md))
- 📝 English-only documentation policy
- 🤖 Copilot and AI prompt instructions
- 🔄 TDD-first workflow for C# (see `copilot-instructions.md`)
- ❓ Follow-up Question Enforcement ([see instructions](.github/instructions/follow-up-question.instructions.md))  
  AI must ask clarifying questions and show confidence before code generation.
